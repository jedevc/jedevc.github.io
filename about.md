Hi!

I'm Justin Chadwell, a computer science student at the University of
Birmingham, and this is my personal website. This is where I'll keep a record
of all my cool projects, and maybe a few thoughts.

This site was built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using the
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
