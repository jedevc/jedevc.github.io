# jedevc.com

This is the source code for my personal website. It's not really much at the
moment, but I'm working hard on improving it.

If you're interested take a look at it [here](https://jedevc.com).

## Running

To run the website locally, execute the following:

	$ git clone https://github.com/jedevc/jedevc.github.io.git
	$ cd jedevc.github.io
	$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
	$ bundle exec jekyll serve
