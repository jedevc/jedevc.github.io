Hi, I'm Justin! I make some things and occasionally write about them here.
My rubber duck won't talk back to me, so I hope that maybe by writing my
problems and projects out here, I'll get some more feedback :)

See my [portfolio](/portfolio/) to see projects that I work on and other things
that I've done or see the [about](/about/) page to find out more about me.

Or you might just be looking for my github, which you can find
[here](https://github.com/jedevc).
