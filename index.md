Hi, I'm Justin! I make some things and occasionally write about them here.
My rubber duck won't talk back to me, so I hope that maybe by writing my
problems and projects out here, I'll get some more feedback :)

See the [about](/about/) page to find out more, or check out my
[github](https://github.com/jedevc).
